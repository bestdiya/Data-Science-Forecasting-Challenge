# Data-Science-Forecasting-Challenge
Weekly Sales Forecasting Challenge
ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive time series forecasting solution for predicting weekly sales quantities across multiple product categories, channels, and brands. The solution includes thorough exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, validation, and forecasting for a 3-month horizon.
ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Explore and understand weekly sales data patterns
Build a robust forecasting model using machine learning
Validate model performance on the last 3 months (Jun-Jul-Aug 2024)
Generate accurate forecasts for the next 3 months (Sep-Oct-Nov 2024)
Provide monthly accuracy metrics and comprehensive analysis

Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
What this notebook does:

âœ… Data quality assessment and cleaning
âœ… Missing value and outlier detection
âœ… Temporal pattern analysis
âœ… Seasonal decomposition
âœ… Category-wise sales breakdown
âœ… Individual time series analysis

Step 2: Forecasting and Modeling

What this notebook does:

âœ… Feature engineering (time-based, lag, rolling statistics)
âœ… Model training with Random Forest
âœ… Validation on last 3 months (Jun-Jul-Aug 2024)
âœ… Monthly accuracy calculation
âœ… Forecast generation for next 3 months (Sep-Oct-Nov 2024)
âœ… Model persistence and reproducibility
